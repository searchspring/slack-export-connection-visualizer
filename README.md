# Slack Export Connection Visualizer

## Prerequisites

- Golang 1.16+
- slack export unzipped into ./data
- email -> department CSV located at ./data/dept.csv

## Running

- Clone the project
- export your data from slack for the date range you're interested in.  Unzip that export in the `./data` directory.
- create a csv `./data/dept.csv` that maps email address to department of the form
    ```
    email, department
    susan@example.com, Marketing
    brad@example.com, Sales
    ```
- optionally, create an ignore list file `./data/ignore.txt` that contains emails of people you don't want to consider.
    ```
    theceo@example.com
    ```

- Run the program

  Set various environment variables to control output and run the program
  ```
  OBFUSCATE_NAMES=true MINIMUM_WORD_COUNT=200 go run main.go
  ```

You'll end up with a `./output` folder that contains 2 files. 
- `people.csv` and 
- `departments.csv`

Copy paste those files into https://app.rawgraphs.io/ to make some pretty visualizations.
